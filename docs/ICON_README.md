# Extension Icon

The extension needs an icon file. Create a 128x128 pixel PNG image and save it as `icon.png` in the root directory.

## Icon Design Suggestions

The icon should represent the "Prompt or Die" concept:
- ðŸŽ¯ Target/bullseye (representing precision in prompting)
- âš¡ Lightning bolt (representing quick thinking)
- ðŸ¤– Robot face (representing AI)
- ðŸ’¬ Chat bubble (representing prompts)
- ðŸŽ® Game controller (representing the gamification aspect)

## Colors

- Consider dark and light theme compatibility
- High contrast for visibility
