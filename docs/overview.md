# AlgoTrendy Codebase Overview

## Current Repository Layout
- `README.md` – contains the project tagline and is currently the primary public-facing description of the repository's intent.
- `LICENSE` – distributes the project under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, which allows usage and modification so long as changes to covered files remain open.

At the time of writing there is no application source code checked into the repository yet. The project is effectively in a "blank slate" state awaiting its first implementation commit.

## Development Priorities
Because there is not yet an implementation to study, new contributors will primarily be involved in establishing the project's foundations. The following high-level tasks will unlock future feature work:

1. **Define the technical scope.** Capture the concrete goals for "professional grade algo strategies and indicators" in an architecture document (supported markets, frequency of data, backtesting/live trading requirements, etc.).
2. **Decide on the technology stack.** Choose the core language(s) and libraries for data ingestion, analysis, and execution, and establish minimal coding standards.
3. **Set up project scaffolding.** Create the initial package layout (for example, a `src/` directory with modules for data, indicators, strategies, and execution) along with basic tooling such as formatting, linting, and testing.
4. **Establish data management workflows.** Determine how market data will be sourced, stored, and refreshed both for historical backtesting and live trading.
5. **Draft contribution guidelines.** Provide instructions for how contributors should open pull requests, run tests, and document new features once code is introduced.

## Suggested Next Steps for New Contributors
- Start a design document (in `docs/`) that articulates the minimum viable system and long-term roadmap.
- Add initial project scaffolding with one end-to-end example strategy to serve as a reference implementation.
- Integrate automated testing and linting (for example, via GitHub Actions) early to keep future contributions maintainable.
- Update the top-level `README.md` as the architecture stabilizes so newcomers always have an accurate entry point.

This document should evolve as soon as core modules land; future updates ought to describe the actual package layout, key abstractions, and the data flow through the system.
