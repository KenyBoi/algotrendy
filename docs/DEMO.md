# Prompt or Die - Demo Challenges

This file contains example challenges that demonstrate the different types of prompting skills you'll develop.

## Example Challenge 1: Basic Email Prompt

**Challenge**: Create a prompt that instructs an AI to write a professional email.

**Goal**: Your prompt should result in a well-structured, professional email with proper greeting, body, and closing.

**Sample Solution**:
```
Write a professional email to a client thanking them for their business and informing them about a new product launch. The email should:
- Use a formal but friendly tone
- Include a clear subject line
- Have proper greeting and closing
- Mention specific benefits of the new product
- Include a call to action
```

## Example Challenge 2: Context Setting

**Challenge**: Create a prompt that provides sufficient context for debugging a JavaScript application.

**Sample Solution**:
```
You are an experienced JavaScript developer helping a junior developer debug their first web application. The application is a todo list built with vanilla JavaScript that's having issues with adding new items. 

Please provide a step-by-step debugging approach that includes:
1. How to use browser developer tools
2. What to look for in the console
3. How to set breakpoints
4. Common JavaScript errors in todo applications
5. How to test the fix

Use simple language and explain any technical terms you use.
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts lead to vague results
2. **Provide Context**: Help the AI understand the situation
3. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what success looks like
4. **Use Examples**: Show what you want when possible
5. **Consider the Audience**: Tailor your prompt to who will use the output
